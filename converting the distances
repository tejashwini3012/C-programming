The distance between two cities (in km.) is input through the keyboard. Write a program to convert and print this distance in meters, feet, inches and centimeters.
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int ds, mt,cm;
float feet,inches;
printf("distance btw two cities in km:");
scanf("%d",&ds);
mt= ds*1000;
cm=ds*100000;
feet=ds*3280.80;
inches=ds*39370.1;
printf("meters:%d\n",mt);
printf("centimeter:%d\n",cm);
printf("feet:%.2f\n",feet);
printf("inches:%.2f\n",inches);
return 0;
}

output:
distance btw two cities in km:3
meters:3000
centimeter:300000
feet:9842.40
inches:118110.30
