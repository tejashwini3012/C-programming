Rameshâ€™s basic salary is input through the keyboard. His dearness allowance is 40% of basic salary, 
and house rent allowance is 20% of basic salary. Write a program to calculate his gross salary.

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
float gs,bs,alloance,hrent;
printf("basic salary bs:");
scanf("%f",&bs);
alloance=0.4*bs;
hrent=0.2*bs;
gs=bs+alloance+hrent;
printf("bs:%.2f\n",bs);
printf("alloance:%.2f\n",alloance);
printf("hrent:%.2f\n",hrent);
printf("gs:%.2f\n",gs);
}

output 
basic salary bs:40000
bs:40000.00
alloance:16000.00
hrent:8000.00
gs:64000.00

or 
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int gs,bs;
printf("basic salary bs:");
scanf("%d",&bs);
gs=bs+(40*bs)/100+(20*bs)/100;
printf("bs:%d\n",bs);
printf("gs:%d\n",gs);
}

output
basic salary bs:5000
bs:5000
gs:8000
